This program, built using Python and Selenium, was designed to streamline the process of generating comprehensive reports by automating the retrieval of geographic coordinates. It was notably the first bot I ever built, marking a significant milestone in my journey with automation and programming.
Key Features:

    Automated Data Retrieval: Utilized Python and Selenium to automatically retrieve geographic coordinates based on street names listed in an Excel file.
    Report Generation: Compiled the retrieved coordinates into a complete and organized report, saving time and reducing manual effort.
    Office Efficiency: Enabled the user to focus on other tasks around the office while the program ran in the background, ensuring reports were completed efficiently without constant supervision.

Usage:

    Private Organizational Use: This program was tailored for internal use within the organization, addressing specific needs for generating location-based reports.
    On-Demand Operation: Executed whenever a new report needed to be completed, the program handled the entire process from data retrieval to report generation.

Though the source code has been lost, the program's design highlights the power of automation in enhancing workplace efficiency and accuracy in data reporting. Its development marked my first successful venture into creating a bot, setting the foundation for future projects.
